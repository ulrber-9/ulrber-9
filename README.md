- 👋 Hi, I’m @ulrber-9
- 👀 I’m interested in public transport (PT) analyses
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use GitHub to share code on trip patterns in PT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing methods to better describe (in time, space and across population groups) and visualise travel patterns, in total and with PT
- 📫 How to reach me: ulrik.berggren@tft.lth.se
